# DM's Handy Haversack

## A Discord Bot aiming to assist Dungeon Masters with managing their campaigns and players.

The end goal is to provide a comprehensive and intuitive tool for Discord servers
that will help DMs manage their games. Things like player characters, NPCs, encounters,
spells and items, pretty much anything that might be useful to have on demand during
a play session. At the moment, this primarily exists as a skeleton bot with a couple
of test commands and a class library with Data Models. As an ongoing project, things 
are obviously subject to revision and growth as needed.
